# 🛡️📹 AI-Powered Industrial Safety Surveillance System

**Organization:** Jyoti CNC Automation, Rajkot  
**Category:** Industry Defined Problem

---

## 📄 Project Overview

This project integrates **AI-powered Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection** and **CCTV-based anomaly surveillance** into a single real-time system. It is designed to improve **workplace safety**, **regulatory compliance**, and **operational efficiency** in industrial environments.

Using advanced **deep learning models** and **computer vision**, the system ensures that workers adhere to safety protocols and that unusual or unsafe activities are promptly flagged.

## ✅ Key Features

### 👷 PPE Detection Module
- Real-time detection of:
  - 🪖 Helmets  
  - 😷 Face Masks  
  - 👷 Safety Vests  
  - 🧤 Gloves  
- Supports live feed from **Webcam/IP Camera**
- Upload and analyze **video/image files**
- Detection logs with timestamps and confidence scores

### 📹 CCTV Anomaly Detection Module
- Real-time detection of:
  - 🚫 Entry into restricted zones  
  - ⚠️ Safety violations (e.g., no helmet, improper behavior)  
  - 🚷 Suspicious or unsafe movements  
- Continuous monitoring via CCTV/IP camera
- Alert generation on detection

### 📊 Dashboard (Built with Streamlit)
- Live status feed with detection results
- Real-time preview of camera feed
- Violation and compliance logs
- Summary statistics and compliance reports
